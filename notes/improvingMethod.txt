Actually, you shouldn't worry too much about knowing extensive C++. Most of the time, the code style that you use in competitive programming is more like C with STL. You probably won't have to know anything about lambda expressions and templates, however they can be useful for making it easier to write code (debatable).

The only advice anybody (including me) will ever give you is to keep on practicing. You should spend some time studying those topics that you know little of (such as graph theory as you mentioned). Try to participate in contests as often as possible. If you miss one, virtually participate when you have the time. This gets you used to Codeforces contests and hopefully your rating will soar :)
